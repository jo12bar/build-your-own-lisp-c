# Build Your Own Lisp in C (my implementation)

My implementation of a Lisp as described in [this book](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/chapter2_installation).
The `master` branch should always work, be deployable, even if it isn't
actually working as a "programming language". All in-development work should be
done on their own respective branches, be merged in via a pull request, and
promptly removed. I know that I'm the only one working on this, so it's not
really necessary, but I'm treating it as an exercise in programming
cleanliness. I might add things, remove things... Let's see what I can do :grin:
